              Preparing for technical interviews
            </p>
            <p class="body pad-s">
              - Practice makes perfect and is never enough<br>

              - Do your homework, be willing to do it upfront<br>

              - The interviewer is just checking if you did it (it being your homework)<br>
              - Do not use pseudo code for the actual interview<br>

              - Moving the cursor on the shared google doc (Courier New font - best for code) when someone is staring down on it is scary af, even the whiteboard is scary af. So prepare by practicing, practice under time pressure, it shouldn't kill you<br>

              - Tell them about the Internship you want to take(if it's ML/AI) tell them, be sure to tell them<br>

              - Information is not shared between interviewers to ensure transparency and avoid any biases<br>

              - Charge phone for the phone interview, get a headset if possible, get pen and paper ready, think out loud so that the interviewer knows that you haven't just gone blank<br>

              The interview
            </p>
            <p class="body pad-s">
              - Tell them the shitty brute force solution that you come up with.<br>
              - Leave extra space on the whiteboard<br>
              - Keep track of the time in the interview<br><br>

              Most interviews are: Standard CS algorithms question hidden away in a dark corner, so don't be afraid

              Common Mistakes
            </p>
            <p class="body pad-s">
              "we" in the following paragraph refers to the interviewers from google<br>
              1. Immediately jumping into code is bad, we want to know how you came up to it and not just what the solution is<br>
                - Can help if you are going down the wrong path that will waste your time<br><br>
              2. Not testing<br>

                - Discuss testing verbally<br>

                - Edge case think<br>

                - Simple case<br>

                - Analyze complexity (Time and Space)<br>

                - Don't waste too much time running a lot of examples<br><br>

              3. Writing in pure pseudocode<br>
                - I am using this helper function, do I implement here? or is it ok<br><br>
              4. Force fitting a solution<br>
                - Listen to the damn interviewer, he's helping you<br><br>
              5. Premature optimization<br>
                - Get your brute force solution up and working before worrying about<br>
                - Sometimes brute force may be the only solution, so don't be afraid to say it<br><br>
              6. Not asking what is to be optimized for before actually coding<br>
            </p>
            <p class="header pad-s">
            <blockquote>Know about Hash Map: Needs to be known to do anything in CS</blockquote>
            </p>
            <p class="header2">
              What are the interviewers actually trying to see?
            </p>
            <p class="body pad-s">
              Are you thinking about your ideas clearly/CRISPLY and are you able to unfold it and explain it to the interviewer<br><br>

              Communicate with the interviewer when thinking, don't just stare, tell me what you're thinking. I don't know is a valid response it shows that you didn't get it but are still not afraid to ask questions. The GOOGLE engineer interviewing you is not flawless, they're your helper and you want to guide them through how you are thinking about the problem.<br><br>

              Whenever they speak to you, think....Are they giving you a hint? are they pointing you towards an edge case? Don't just blankly ignore them<br><br>

              They might help with you the initial hurdle and maybe even help you calm down so that you can perform better.<br><br>
            </p>

              PRACTICE PROBLEM: WIGGLE SORT
            </p>
            <p class="body pad-s">
              <blockquote>Sort an array of number u = [u1, u2, ..... uN] so that the sorted version is [s1, s2, .....sN] the following wiggly inequalities apply s1 <= s2 >= s3 <= s4 ......

            </p>
            <p class="body">
              If you get this solution really quickly the interviewer might impose these challenges on you:<br>
               - Huge upper bound on size of array<br>
               - The array elements are doubles<br>
               - Can you prove that there is not a better way to do it?<br>
               - Can you parallelize it, and does it improve the efficiency? <br><blockquote>AS IN DO YOU OPTIMIZE THE BOTTLENECK?</blockquote>
             </p>
             <p class="body">
              Express your optimization in a way that helps bring out the factors you want to optimize<br><br>

              You're not looking for that perfect solution, we want to know if you can structure your code in some sane way. Syntax is secondary, closing brackets, semi colons are secondary.<br><br>

              I also got to speak to Caitlin, and I asked her on resume tips after which she informed me of a follow up email coming up soon, that would include an article from Google's former SVP of People Operation, whose name she didn't mention but I prompted and confirmed that is was none other than Lazlo Bock. Coming back to the email, she said it would include the link to an article of his on how to structure your resume bullets for the best result.
