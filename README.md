# Google Technical Interview Workshop
@GoogleStudents
## Pre Pre Workshop
Just spoke to one of the people presenting and I asked him to give me some feedback on my resume. He gave me his personal email id and told me that he was 200 emails behind....He told me to remind him if he does not respond within a week. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa I'm going crazy by the hype

## Pre Workshop
It's 6:50 pm and the room is fairly very empty. At this time we have one pizza box per person.

We just saw the shit ton of google stickers, socks and diaries that we're gonna get. Tons of Pizza and drinks. It's gonna be a good night

5 minutes later, people are starting to pour in and it's gonna be hype

It's 6:57 I am gonna help them layout some swag
## Workshop....

It's 7:04 a shit ton of people turned up, I missed out on coke and some pizza but it's alright since I helped 
# GOOGLE
at laying out their swag

Got some recogonition yall!! Whoop Whoop

It's started now,

Caitlin McDonough: Google Waterloo, ON, Canada: University Specialist, gets to come to Uni often.

## GOOGLERS: from Mountain View

Rosanne Borja, Analytics Front End four years ago graduated Software Engineer

James Zunz: Software Engineer at Google CE graduate, Deep Learning Team in Search 

### Resume
GPA: Not everything but an indication of success at Google, Apply WaterlooWorks and Google website also

Talk about end result over how you did it
Designed, Implemented, Configures
Accomplished X by doing Y using Z. Assign metric and it improves your story

Demonstrate how used techincal skills to solve real world problems and improve your effiecy

Leadership and team-work skills are key

# Interview

## Steps for applying:
1. Apply at google students
2. Coding sample(unlimited tries for trial of the software) and Snapshot survey (90 minutes for coding sample and 15 minutes Snapshot Survey)
3. 2 - 3 phone screens: Shared google doc as interview white board
4. Engineering Review and Host Match
5. Hiring Committee Review
6. Offer

1. Data Structures
2. Algorithms
3. Analysis of your code (time/space complexities)

## Preparing for technical interviews
Practice makes perfect and never enough

Flipping through the table of contents

Do your homework, be willing to do it upfront

The interviewer is just checking if you did it, do not use pseudo code

Moving the cursor on the shared google doc when someone is staring down on it is scary af, even the whiteboard is scary af. So prepare by practicing, practice under time pressure, it shouldn't kill you

Tell them about the Internship(if it's ML/AI) tell them you want to take, but tell them

Information is not shared between interviewers to ensure transparency and avoid any biases
 
3. Charge phone, headset,pen paper, Courier New font, think out loud and

## The interview
Tell them the shitty brute force solution that you come up with.

Standard CS algorithms question hidden away in a dark corner, so don't be afraid

## Common Mistakes
1. Immediately jumping into code is bad, we want to know how you came up to it and not just what the solution is
  a. Can help if you are going down the wrong path that will waste your time
2. Not testing
  a. Discuss testing verbally
  b. Edge case think
  c. Simple case
  d. Analyse complexity (Time and Space)
  e. Don't waste too much time running a lot of examples
3. Writing in pure pseudocode
  a. I am using this helper function, do I implement here? or is it ok
4. Force fitting a solution
  a. Listen to the fuckin interviewer, he's helping you
5. Premature optimisation
  a. Get your brute force solution up and working before worrying about 
  b. Sometimes brute force may be the only solution, so don't be afraid to say it

# Know about Hash Map: Needs to be known to do anything in CS

Are you thinking about your ideas clearly/CRISPLY and are you able to unfold it and explain it to the interviewer

Communicate with the interviewer when thinking, don't just stare, tell me what your'e thinking. I don't know is a valid response, I didn't get it. The GOOGLE engineer is not flawless, they're your helper and you want to guide them through how you are thinking about the problem.

Are they giving you a hint, are they pointing you towards an edge case.

They might help with you the initial hurdle and maybe like help you calm down.

# PRACTICE PROBLEM: WIGGLE SORT

Sort an array of number u = [u1, u2, ..... uN] so that the sorted version is [s1, s2, .....sN]
the following wiggly inequalities apply s1 <= s2 >= s3 <= s4 ......

 - Huge upper bound on size of array 
 - The array elements are doubles
 
 Ask what is to be optimised for before actually coding

You're not looking for that perfect solution, we want to know if you can structure your code in some sane way. Syntax is secondary, closing brackets, semi colons are secondary.

Can you prove that there is not a better way to do it
Can you parallelize it, and does it improve the efficiency? AS IN DO YOU OPTIMISE THE BOTTLENECK

Express your optimisiation in a way that helps bring out the factors you want to optimise
Overfitting is a big problem

Leave extra space on the whiteboard
Keep track of the time in the interview
